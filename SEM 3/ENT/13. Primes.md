## 1. Divisibility and primes

Let $a,b$ be integers with $b\ne0$.

We say **$b$ divides $a$**, written $b\mid a$, if there exists an integer $k$ such that
$$
a = bk.
$$

An integer $n>1$ is:

- **prime** if its only positive divisors are $1$ and $n$,
- **composite** if it is not prime and $>1$.

Notes:

- $2$ is the only even prime.
- $1$ is neither prime nor composite.

Examples:

- primes: $2,3,5,7,11,13,\dots$
- composites: $4,6,8,9,10,12,\dots$

## 2. Euclid’s Lemma

This is the key fact about primes.

**Lemma.**  
If $p$ is prime and $p\mid ab$, then $p\mid a$ or $p\mid b$.

**Proof.**

Assume $p\mid ab$ and $p\nmid a$.  
Since $p$ is prime and does not divide $a$, we have $\gcd(a,p)=1$.

From $p\mid ab$ we have
$$
ab \equiv 0 \pmod{p}.
$$

Because $\gcd(a,p)=1$, $a$ has a multiplicative inverse modulo $p$, call it $a^{-1}$. Multiply both sides by $a^{-1}$ modulo $p$:

$$
b \equiv a^{-1} \cdot 0 \equiv 0 \pmod{p},
$$

so $p\mid b$.

Thus $p\mid a$ or $p\mid b$. ▢

**Iterated form.**

If $p$ is prime and $p\mid a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n$, then
$$
p\mid a_i \quad \text{for some } i.
$$

Proof is by repeated application of Euclid’s Lemma.

This lemma is the engine behind uniqueness of prime factorisation.

## 3. Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (FTA)

**Theorem.**

Every integer $n>1$ can be written as a product of primes.  
This factorisation is **unique**, up to the order of the factors.

We break it into two parts.

### 3.1 Existence: every $n>1$ is a product of primes

Proof is by (strong) induction on $n$.

- Base: $n=2$ is prime, so itself a product of primes.
- Inductive step: assume all integers $2,\dots,n-1$ are products of primes.
  - If $n$ is prime, done.
  - If $n$ is composite, write $n=ab$ with $1<a,b<n$.
    By induction, both $a$ and $b$ are products of primes.
    Hence $n$ is a product of primes.

So every $n>1$ has at least one prime factorisation. 

### 3.2 Uniqueness

Suppose
$$
n = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_r = q_1 q_2 \cdots q_s
$$
are two prime factorizations (all $p_i,q_j$ prime).

1. By Euclid’s Lemma applied to $p_1 \mid q_1\cdots q_s$, we must have $p_1 = q_j$ for some $j$.
2. Cancel that common prime from both sides; obtain a shorter equality.
3. Repeat the argument.

Formally, after rearranging indices we get $p_1=q_1$, cancel, then $p_2=q_2$, etc., and finally $r=s$ and all primes match.

Thus factorisation is unique up to order. ▢

---

## 4. Canonical prime factorisation

For $n>1$, there is a unique expression

$$
n = p_1^{\alpha_1} p_2^{\alpha_2} \cdots p_k^{\alpha_k},
$$

where:

- $p_1 < p_2 < \dots < p_k$ are distinct primes,
- $\alpha_i \ge 1$.

This is the **canonical prime factorisation** of $n$.

Examples:

- $4200 = 2^3 \cdot 3 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7$.
- $10780 = 2^2 \cdot 5 \cdot 7^2 \cdot 11$.

---

## 5. gcd and lcm from prime factorisation

Let

$$
a = \prod_{i} p_i^{\alpha_i}, \qquad
b = \prod_{i} p_i^{\beta_i},
$$

where missing primes have exponent $0$.

Then:

- Greatest common divisor:
  $$
  \gcd(a,b) = \prod_{i} p_i^{\min(\alpha_i,\beta_i)}.
  $$
- Least common multiple:
  $$
  \operatorname{lcm}(a,b) = \prod_{i} p_i^{\max(\alpha_i,\beta_i)}.
  $$

Useful identity:

$$
\gcd(a,b)\cdot \operatorname{lcm}(a,b) = ab.
$$

---

## 6. Exact power notation

We write

$$
p^\alpha \parallel n
$$

if:

- $p^\alpha \mid n$,
- but $p^{\alpha+1} \nmid n$.

i.e. $\alpha$ is the largest exponent of the prime $p$ dividing $n$.

---

## 7. Number of divisors function

Let
$$
n = p_1^{\alpha_1} \cdots p_k^{\alpha_k}.
$$

Every positive divisor $d$ of $n$ has the form

$$
d = p_1^{e_1} \cdots p_k^{e_k},
$$

where $0 \le e_i \le \alpha_i$ for each $i$.

So for each $i$, there are $(\alpha_i+1)$ choices for $e_i$.

Hence the number of positive divisors of $n$ is

$$
\tau(n) = (\alpha_1+1)(\alpha_2+1)\cdots(\alpha_k+1).
$$

Example:

$$
24 = 2^3\cdot3^1 \Rightarrow \tau(24) = (3+1)(1+1) = 8,
$$

divisors: $1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24$.

## 8. A sample structure theorem mod 3

A useful pattern (matching your notes):

**Claim.**  
Every integer of the form $3n+2$ has at least one prime factor of the form $3k+2$.

**Reason.**

Write $3n+2$ as a product of primes.
By the Division Algorithm, any prime is of the form $3k$, $3k+1$, or $3k+2$.

- A prime of form $3k$ is just $3$.
- $(3k+1)(3\ell+1) \equiv 1\cdot1 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$.
- $(3k+1)3 \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$.

Neither can give residue $2$ modulo $3$.

So to get overall residue $2$, at least one prime factor must itself be $3k+2$.

This is the typical “prime of same form divides” argument used in many exercises.

## 9. Gaussian integers $\mathbb{Z}[i]$

Now extend to complex integers to study sums of two squares.

### 9.1 Definition

The **Gaussian integers** are

$$
\mathbb{Z}[i] = \{a+bi : a,b\in\mathbb{Z}\},
$$

with usual addition and multiplication.

### 9.2 Norm

Define the **norm** $N:\mathbb{Z}[i]\to\mathbb{N}$ by

$$
N(a+bi) = a^2 + b^2.
$$

Key properties:

1. $N(z) \ge 0$ and $N(z)=0$ iff $z=0$.
2. Multiplicative:
   $$
   N(zw) = N(z)\,N(w).
   $$

Proof (direct expansion) is routine.

### 9.3 Units and primes in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$

Elements with norm $1$ are
$$
1,-1,i,-i.
$$

These are the **units** (invertible elements).

In $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ we define “prime” (irreducible) similarly:
$z$ is prime if whenever $z\mid ab$, then $z\mid a$ or $z\mid b$ (inside $\mathbb{Z}[i]$).

Because $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ has a Euclidean algorithm using the norm, it is a **unique factorisation domain**:

- every nonzero, nonunit $z$ factors uniquely (up to order and units) into Gaussian primes.

This parallels the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.

### 9.4 Rational primes inside $\mathbb{Z}[i]$

Let $p$ be an ordinary prime in $\mathbb{Z}$.

Then in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$:

1. $p=2$ factors as
   $$
   2 = (1+i)(1-i),
   $$
   so not prime in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$.

2. If $p\equiv 3 \pmod{4}$, then $p$ stays prime in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$.

3. If $p\equiv 1 \pmod{4}$, then $p$ is **not** prime in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$; it factors as
   $$
   p = \pi \overline{\pi},
   $$
   where $\pi = a+bi$ is a Gaussian prime, and then
   $$
   p = a^2 + b^2.
   $$

This third case is the key to the sum of two squares theorem.

---

## 10. Sum of two squares theorem (outline)

**Theorem.**

An odd prime $p$ can be written as
$$
p = a^2 + b^2
$$
with integers $a,b$ **iff** $p\equiv 1 \pmod{4}$.

We sketch the direction matching your notes:  
if $p\equiv 1 \pmod{4}$ then $p = a^2 + b^2$.

### 10.1 Key ideas

1. Because $p\equiv 1 \pmod{4}$, there exists an integer $x$ with
   $$
   x^2 \equiv -1 \pmod{p}.
   $$
   (From group theory or by counting arguments; equivalently, $-1$ is a quadratic residue mod $p$.)

2. Then $p$ divides $x^2+1 = (x+i)(x-i)$ in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$.

3. In $\mathbb{Z}[i]$, $p$ is not prime (since $p\equiv 1\pmod{4}$). So there exists a nonunit $\pi = a+bi$ such that
   $$
   p = \pi\overline{\pi} = (a+bi)(a-bi) = a^2 + b^2.
   $$

4. Because of unique factorisation in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$, this representation is essentially unique up to signs and order.

That matches the structure of the handwritten Gaussian-integer notes: they use gcd in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ and factorisation to deduce
$$
p = c^2 + d^2
$$
for primes $p\equiv 1\pmod{4}$, and then extend this to certain composite numbers.

### 10.2 Example

Show that $12277$ is a sum of two squares.

Factor (for illustration assume known or computed):

If $12277$ is prime and $12277 \equiv 1\pmod{4}$, then by the theorem there exist $a,b$ with
$$
12277 = a^2 + b^2.
$$

Your notes exhibit
$$
12277 = 89^2 + 66^2.
$$

Indeed
$$
89^2 = 7921,\quad 66^2 = 4356,\quad 7921+4356=12277.
$$

The underlying reason is the factorisation of $12277$ in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$.
