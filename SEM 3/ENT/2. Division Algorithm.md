## Statement

Let

- $a$ be **any integer** (positive, negative, or zero),
- $b$ be a **positive integer** (that is, $b\in\mathbb{Z}$ and $b>0$).

The Division Algorithm says:

**There exist unique integers $q$ and $r$ such that**
$$
a = bq + r ,\qquad 0 \le r < b.
$$

Here:

- $q$ is the **quotient**,  
- $r$ is the **remainder**,  
- $0 \le r < b$ is the **remainder condition**.

# Part I — Existence

We want to show that some integers $q$ and $r$ satisfying  
$a=bq+r$ and $0\le r<b$ **must** exist.

We construct them using a well-ordered set.

---

## Step 1 — Construct the candidate set

Define
$$
S = \{\, a - bk : k\in\mathbb{Z},\ a - bk \ge 0 \,\}.
$$

Meaning:

- Let $k$ range over all integers.
- Compute $a - bk$ for each one.
- Keep only the nonnegative values.
- These values form $S$.

Each element of $S$ is a potential remainder.

---

## Step 2 — Show $S$ is not empty

Choose the specific integer
$$
k_0 = -(|a| + 1).
$$

Compute:
$$
a - b k_0
= a - b\big(-(|a|+1)\big)
= a + b(|a|+1).
$$

Because $b>0$ and $|a|+1\ge 1$,
$$
b(|a|+1) \ge b > 0,
$$
so
$$
a + b(|a|+1) \ge a + 1 > 0.
$$

Thus
$$
a - b k_0 > 0,
$$
so $a - b k_0 \in S$.

Therefore **$S$ is nonempty**.

---

## Step 3 — Apply the Well-Ordering Principle

$S$ is a nonempty set of nonnegative integers.  
By the Well-Ordering Principle, it has a **least element**.  
Call this element $r$:
$$
r = \min S.
$$

Because $r\in S$, there exists an integer $q$ such that
$$
r = a - bq,
$$
and also $r\ge 0$.

So already:
$$
a = bq + r,\qquad r\ge 0.
$$

---

## Step 4 — Prove $r<b$

Assume for contradiction that $r\ge b$.

Compute:
$$
r - b = (a - bq) - b = a - b(q+1).
$$

Now check:

1. Since $r\ge b$,  
   $$
   r - b \ge 0.
   $$
2. The expression $a - b(q+1)$ has the form $a - bk$ for the integer $k=q+1$.

So $r - b \in S$.

But clearly
$$
r - b < r,
$$
contradicting the fact that $r$ is the smallest element of $S$.

Therefore the assumption $r\ge b$ is impossible.  
Hence:
$$
0 \le r < b.
$$

---

# Part II — Uniqueness

Assume two valid representations:
$$
a = bq + r = bq' + r',
$$
with
$$
0 \le r,r' < b.
$$

---

## Step 1 — Subtract the two equations

Subtracting gives:
$$
b(q - q') = r' - r.
$$

---

## Step 2 — Bound the right-hand side

Since $0\le r,r' < b$,
$$
-b < r' - r < b,
$$
so
$$
|r' - r| < b.
$$

---

## Step 3 — Use the multiple-of-$b$ argument

From the earlier subtraction step,
$$
r' - r = b(q - q').
$$

Thus $r' - r$ is:

- a **multiple of $b$**, and
- satisfies $|r'-r| < b$.

The only multiple of $b$ with absolute value strictly less than $b$ is $0$.  
Therefore:
$$
r' - r = 0 \quad\Longrightarrow\quad r' = r.
$$

Then plugging back:
$$
b(q - q') = 0
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
q = q'.
$$

Thus **both** the quotient and remainder are unique.
