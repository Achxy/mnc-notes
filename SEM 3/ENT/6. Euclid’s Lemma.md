## Statement

Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be integers.  
If
- $a \mid bc$, and  
- $\gcd(a,b) = 1$,

then  
$$
a \mid c.
$$

This is one of the most important tools in number theory.

# Proof (using Bézout’s identity)

Given $\gcd(a,b) = 1$, Bézout’s identity guarantees the existence of integers $x$ and $y$ such that
$$
1 = ax + by.
$$

Multiply both sides by $c$:
$$
c = c \cdot 1
= c(ax + by)
= acx + bcy.
$$

Now analyze each term:

- $acx$ is a multiple of $a$, so  
  $$
  a \mid acx.
  $$
- We are given that $a \mid bc$, so $a \mid bcy$ (multiplying a multiple by an integer preserves divisibility).

Thus **both terms** on the right side are divisible by $a$:
$$
a \mid acx, \qquad a \mid bcy.
$$

Hence their sum is also divisible by $a$:
$$
a \mid (acx + bcy).
$$

But
$$
acx + bcy = c.
$$

Therefore:
$$
a \mid c.
$$

This completes the proof.
