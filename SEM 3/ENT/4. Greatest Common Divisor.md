## Definition

Let $a$ and $b$ be integers, **not both zero**.  
The **greatest common divisor** of $a$ and $b$, written  
$$
\gcd(a,b)
$$
is the **positive integer** $d$ satisfying:

1. $d \mid a$ and $d \mid b$,  
2. if $c$ is any integer with $c \mid a$ and $c \mid b$, then $c \le d$.

Thus $d$ is the **largest positive integer that divides both** $a$ and $b$.

## Examples

- $\gcd(-5, 5) = 5$  
- $\gcd(8, 17) = 1$  
- $\gcd(-8, -36) = 4$

# Bézout’s Theorem

**Theorem.**  
If $a$ and $b$ are integers, not both zero, then there exist integers $x$ and $y$ such that  
$$
\gcd(a,b) = ax + by.
$$

This is one of the most fundamental results in number theory.

# Proof of Bézout’s Theorem  
(using the Well-Ordering Principle + Division Algorithm)

We present a careful and complete proof.

---

## Step 1 — Construct a special set

Define the set
$$
S = \{\, au + bv : u,v\in\mathbb{Z},\ au+bv > 0 \,\}.
$$

Interpretation:

- $S$ contains **all positive integer linear combinations** of $a$ and $b$.
- Even if $a$ or $b$ is negative, $au+bv$ can be positive.

---

## Step 2 — Prove $S$ is not empty

We must exhibit some integers $u,v$ for which $au + bv > 0$.

Case 1: $a \neq 0$  
Then $|a| = |a|\cdot 1 + b\cdot 0$ is a positive integer linear combination of $a$ and $b$.  
Thus $|a| \in S$.

Case 2: $a = 0$  
Then $b \neq 0$.  
Take $au+bv = 0\cdot u + b\cdot v = b v$.  
Choosing $v = 1$ or $v = -1$ gives $|b| > 0$, so $|b| \in S$.

Thus $S$ is nonempty.

---

## Step 3 — Apply the Well-Ordering Principle

Since $S$ is a nonempty set of **positive integers**, it has a smallest element.  
Call this smallest element **$d$**:
$$
d = au_0 + bv_0,
$$
for some integers $u_0, v_0$.

At this point, we have found a **positive integer linear combination** of $a$ and $b$ that is **as small as possible**.

---

## Step 4 — Claim: $d = \gcd(a,b)$

We now prove this claim.

---

## Step 5 — Show that $d$ divides both $a$ and $b$

Using the Division Algorithm, divide $a$ by $d$:
$$
a = dq + r,\qquad 0 \le r < d.
$$

We will show $r=0$.

Substitute $d = au_0 + bv_0$:
$$
\begin{aligned}
r &= a - dq \\
  &= a - q(au_0 + bv_0) \\
  &= a(1 - q u_0) + b(-q v_0) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

This expression shows:
- $r$ is a linear combination of $a$ and $b$,
- and if $r > 0$, then $r$ would be a **positive** element of $S$.

But recall:

- $0 \le r < d$,
- $d$ is the **smallest** positive element of $S$.

Thus $r$ cannot be positive.

Hence:
$$
r = 0.
$$

So:
$$
d \mid a.
$$

A completely symmetric argument applied to $b$ gives:
$$
d \mid b.
$$

Thus $d$ is a **common divisor** of $a$ and $b$.

---

## Step 6 — Prove that $d$ is the **greatest** common divisor

Let $c$ be any positive integer such that

- $c \mid a$, and  
- $c \mid b$.

Then $a = c a_1$ and $b = c b_1$ for some integers $a_1, b_1$.

Since $d = au_0 + bv_0$, substitute:
$$
d = c a_1 u_0 + c b_1 v_0 = c(a_1 u_0 + b_1 v_0).
$$

Thus:
$$
c \mid d.
$$

Because $c$ is positive and $c \mid d$, we must have:
$$
c \le d.
$$

Therefore $d$ is divisible by **every** positive common divisor of $a$ and $b$,  
and so $d$ is the **greatest** common divisor.

This proves:
$$
d = \gcd(a,b).
$$
