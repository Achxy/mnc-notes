## Statement (everything explicitly defined)

Let $\mathbb{N}$ denote the set of **nonnegative integers**:
$$
\mathbb{N} = \{0,1,2,3,\dots\}.
$$

The **Well-Ordering Principle** states:

**Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least (smallest) element.**

Formally:

If $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ and $S \neq \varnothing$,  
then there exists an element $m \in S$ such that  
$$
m \le s \quad \text{for all } s \in S.
$$

# Why This Matters

The Well-Ordering Principle is a foundational tool in proofs.  
It allows us to:

- prove the Division Algorithm,
- prove the Principle of Mathematical Induction,
- reason about minimal counterexamples,
- extract structure from infinite sets of integers.

It is one of the pillars of elementary number theory.

# Detailed Proof (using the Least Upper Bound alternative axiom)

There are many equivalent proofs.  
This version is simple and completely rigorous.

---

## Step 1 — Understand the setting

We have a subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$.

We assume:

- $S$ is **nonempty**,  
- every element of $S$ is a nonnegative integer.

We want to show:  
$S$ contains a **smallest** element.

Since $S$ contains integers only, the order is discrete.

---

## Step 2 — Consider the set of all lower bounds

A **lower bound** of $S$ is a number $L$ such that  
$$
L \le s,\quad\text{for all } s \in S.
$$

In $\mathbb{N}$, any integer $\le$ an element of $S$ acts as a lower bound.

At a minimum, $0$ is always a lower bound of $S$ because  
$0 \le s$ for every $s\in\mathbb{N}$.

Thus the set of lower bounds is nonempty.

---

## Step 3 — Observe that any nonempty subset of integers bounded below has a minimum

Because the integers are **discrete** and **well-ordered by $\le$ when bounded below**,  
a nonempty set of integers that has a lower bound cannot extend infinitely downward.  
It must “hit bottom.”

To make this precise:

Let $B$ be the set of all lower bounds of $S$.  
Then $B$ is nonempty and $B \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$.

A fundamental fact about $\mathbb{Z}$:

> Every nonempty set of integers that is bounded above has a **maximum**.

Apply this to $B$:

- $B$ is bounded above by any element of $S$ (since all lower bounds are $\le$ elements of $S$),
- hence $B$ has a **maximum**, call it $m$.

Thus $m$ is the **greatest lower bound** of $S$.

---

## Step 4 — Show that this greatest lower bound is actually in $S$

We claim $m \in S$.

Proof:

- Since $m$ is a lower bound of $S$,  
  $$
  m \le s \quad \text{for all } s \in S.
  $$

- Suppose $m$ is **not** in $S$.

  Since elements of $S$ are integers, the smallest candidate in $S$ must be at least $m+1$.

  That means every $s\in S$ satisfies:
  $$
  s \ge m+1.
  $$

  But then $m+1$ is also a lower bound of $S$.

  This contradicts the fact that $m$ was the **greatest** lower bound.

Thus the assumption is false, and we must have:
$$
m \in S.
$$

---

## Step 5 — Conclude that $m$ is the least element of $S$

Since:

- $m \in S$, and  
- $m \le s$ for all $s \in S$,

it follows that:

**$m$ is the smallest element of $S$.**

This completes the proof of the Well-Ordering Principle.

---

# Summary

If $S$ is a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$, then:

1. $S$ is bounded below.  
2. Its set of lower bounds has a greatest element $m$.  
3. That element $m$ must lie in $S$.  
4. Therefore $m$ is the smallest element of $S$.

Thus **every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element**.
