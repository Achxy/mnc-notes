## Definition

Two integers $a$ and $b$, not both zero, are said to be **relatively prime** (or **coprime**) when
$$
\gcd(a,b) = 1.
$$

This means that the only positive integer dividing both $a$ and $b$ is $1$.

---

## Examples

- $13$ and $25$ are relatively prime.  
- $\gcd(-12, 30) = 6$ and  
  $$
  \gcd\!\left(\frac{-12}{6}, \frac{30}{6}\right)
  = \gcd(-2, 5)
  = 1,
  $$
  so dividing by the gcd gives coprime numbers.

# Characterization Theorem (Bézout Form)

**Theorem.**  
Let $a$ and $b$ be integers, not both zero.  
Then $a$ and $b$ are **relatively prime** if and only if  
there exist integers $x$ and $y$ such that
$$
1 = ax + by.
$$

This is the specialized Bézout identity in the gcd = 1 case.

---

# Proof (simple, direct)

### (“Only if” direction)

Assume $\gcd(a,b)=1$.  
From Bézout’s identity we already know that  
$$
\gcd(a,b) = ax + by
$$
for some integers $x,y$.

Since the gcd is $1$, this becomes
$$
1 = ax + by.
$$

Thus integers $x,y$ exist with $ax + by = 1$.

---

### (“If” direction)

Assume there exist integers $x$ and $y$ such that
$$
1 = ax + by.
$$

Then any common divisor $d$ of $a$ and $b$ divides the right side:

- If $d \mid a$ and $d \mid b$,  
  then $d \mid (ax)$ and $d \mid (by)$.

Thus $d$ divides the sum:
$$
d \mid (ax + by) = 1.
$$

The only positive divisor of $1$ is $1$ itself.  
Hence:
$$
\gcd(a,b) = 1.
$$

This completes the characterization.

# Useful Corollary

If $\gcd(a,b)=d$, then
$$
\gcd\!\left(\frac{a}{d}, \frac{b}{d}\right) = 1.
$$

### Explanation

If $d = \gcd(a,b)$, then  
$$
a = da', \qquad b = db',
$$
for integers $a',b'$ with no common positive divisor except $1$.  
Thus $\gcd(a',b') = 1$.

# Important Theorem

**Theorem.**  
If $a \mid c$ and $b \mid c$, and $\gcd(a,b)=1$,  
then  
$$
ab \mid c.
$$

This is a fundamental property:  
coprime divisors multiply.

---

# Proof

Given:

- $a \mid c$  
  so $c = ar$ for some integer $r$,
- $b \mid c$  
  so $c = bs$ for some integer $s$,
- $\gcd(a,b)=1$  
  so Bézout gives integers $x,y$ with  
  $$
  1 = ax + by.
  $$

### Multiply both sides by $c$:

$$
c \cdot 1 = c(ax + by)
= cax + cby.
$$

Substitute $c = ar$ and $c = bs$:

$$
c = (ar)(ax) + (bs)(by)
= a(bsx) + b(ary).
$$

Rewrite:

$$
c = ab(sx + ry).
$$

Since $sx + ry$ is an integer, call it $k$, we have:

$$
c = abk.
$$

Thus:
$$
ab \mid c.
$$

# Why the coprime condition is essential

If $\gcd(a,b) \ne 1$, the statement fails.

Example:

- $6 \mid 24$  
- $8 \mid 24$  
but  
- $6 \cdot 8 = 48 \nmid 24$.

Because $\gcd(6,8) = 2 \ne 1$.

The theorem is only valid when $a$ and $b$ share no common factors.
