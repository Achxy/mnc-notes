## Definition

Let $a$ and $b$ be integers with **$a \neq 0$**.  
We say **“$a$ divides $b$”**, written  
$$
a \mid b,
$$
if and only if there exists an integer $c$ such that  
$$
b = ac.
$$

In this case, $a$ is a **divisor** of $b$, and $b$ is a **multiple** of $a$.

# Basic Properties of Divisibility

Let $a, b, c$ be integers, with $a \neq 0$, $b \neq 0$ when required.

We list each property and justify it clearly.

## (a) $a \mid 0$, $1 \mid a$, and $a \mid a$.

**Proofs:**

- $a \mid 0$ because $0 = a \cdot 0$.
- $1 \mid a$ because $a = 1 \cdot a$.
- $a \mid a$ because $a = a \cdot 1$.

---

## (b) $a \mid 1$ if and only if $a = \pm 1$.

**Proof:**

- If $a \mid 1$, then $1 = ac$ for some integer $c$.  
  Only possibilities are $(a,c) = (1,1)$ or $(-1,-1)$.  
  Hence $a = \pm 1$.

- Conversely, if $a = \pm 1$, then $1 = (\pm 1)(\pm 1)$, so $a \mid 1$.

---

## (c) If $a \mid b$ and $c \mid d$, then $ac \mid bd$.

**Proof:**

- $a \mid b$ means $b = ak$ for some integer $k$.  
- $c \mid d$ means $d = c\ell$ for some integer $\ell$.

Multiply:
$$
bd = (ak)(c\ell) = (ac)(k\ell),
$$
so $ac \mid bd$.

---

## (d) If $a \mid b$ and $b \mid c$, then $a \mid c$.

**Proof (transitivity):**

- $b = ak$ for some $k$.  
- $c = b\ell$ for some $\ell$.

Substitute:
$$
c = b\ell = (ak)\ell = a(k\ell),
$$
so $a \mid c$.

---

## (e) $a \mid b$ and $b \mid a$ if and only if $a = \pm b$.

**Proof:**

If $a \mid b$, then $b = a k$.  
If $b \mid a$, then $a = b m$.

Combining:
$$
a = b m = (a k)m = a(km).
$$

Since $a \neq 0$, cancel to get:
$$
km = 1.
$$

The only integer solutions to $km = 1$ are $(k,m) = (1,1)$ or $(-1,-1)$.  
Thus $b = ak$ implies $b = \pm a$.

Conversely, if $a = \pm b$, the divisibility in both directions is immediate.

---

## (f) If $a \mid b$ and $b = 0$, then $|a| \le |b|$.

This is often stated as:

> If $a \mid 0$, then any nonzero divisor of $0$ must satisfy $|a| \ge 1$  
> and still divides $0$ regardless of magnitude.

To match your text precisely:

Since $a \mid b$ and $b=0$, the condition is  
$$
0 = ac.
$$

If $a \neq 0$, then $c = 0$.  
Thus the statement $|a| \le |b|$ must be interpreted carefully:  
because $b = 0$, the only integer $a$ satisfying $a \mid 0$ are **all nonzero integers**,  
while $|b| = 0$.  
Hence this line is typically meant for a particular context, not as a general property.

---

## (g) If $a \mid b$ and $a \mid c$, then  
$$
a \mid (bx + cy)
$$
for all integers $x$ and $y$.

**Proof:**

$a \mid b$ gives $b = ak$.  
$a \mid c$ gives $c = a\ell$.

Then:
$$
bx + cy = (ak)x + (a\ell)y = a(kx + \ell y).
$$

Since $kx+\ell y$ is an integer, $a \mid (bx + cy)$.

This property is fundamental in greatest common divisor theory  
and is used heavily in linear Diophantine equations.
