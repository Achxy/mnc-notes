## 1. What is a linear Diophantine equation?

A **linear Diophantine equation in two variables** is an equation of the form

$$
ax + by = c
$$

where

- $a,b,c$ are given integers (with not both $a,b$ zero),
- we are interested **only in integer solutions** $(x,y)$.

Key questions:

1. When does an integer solution exist?
2. If it exists, how do we find **all** integer solutions?
3. Among these, how do we extract **positive** solutions or solutions satisfying extra conditions?

Everything starts with the gcd of $a$ and $b$.

## 2. The gcd condition (existence)

Let $d = \gcd(a,b)$.

**Theorem (existence).**  
The equation $ax+by=c$ has an integer solution $(x,y)$ **if and only if** $d \mid c$.

### 2.1 Why $d$ must divide $c$

Assume $(x,y)$ is an integer solution:

$$
ax+by=c.
$$

Because $d$ divides both $a$ and $b$, it divides every linear combination of $a$ and $b$, hence it divides $ax+by$, so

$$
d \mid c.
$$

So: if a solution exists, $d$ must divide $c$. Necessary condition.

### 2.2 Why $d \mid c$ is also sufficient

Now assume $d \mid c$. Write $c = d k$ for some integer $k$.

By definition of gcd, there exist integers $u,v$ such that

$$
a u + b v = d.
$$

(This comes from running the Euclidean algorithm backward.)

Multiply both sides by $k$:

$$
a(uk) + b(vk) = dk = c.
$$

So

- $x_0 = uk$,
- $y_0 = vk$

is a concrete integer solution of $ax+by=c$.

Thus if $d\mid c$, at least one solution exists. Sufficient condition.

**Conclusion:** $ax+by=c$ has integer solutions $\iff \gcd(a,b)\mid c$.

## 3. All solutions once one solution is known

Now suppose:

- $d = \gcd(a,b)$,
- $d \mid c$,
- $(x_0,y_0)$ is one integer solution of $ax+by=c$.

We want every other solution $(x,y)$.

Start from the equation for both solutions:

1. $ax_0 + by_0 = c$,
2. $ax + by = c$.

Subtract (2) − (1):

$$
a(x - x_0) + b(y - y_0) = 0.
$$

Rearrange:

$$
a(x - x_0) = -b(y - y_0).
$$

So $a(x-x_0)$ is a multiple of $b$, and $b(y-y_0)$ is a multiple of $a$.

Use the gcd structure. Write

$$
a = d a',\quad b = d b',
$$

with $\gcd(a',b') = 1$.

Then

$$
d a'(x-x_0) = -d b'(y-y_0)
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
a'(x-x_0) = -b'(y-y_0).
$$

So $a'(x-x_0)$ is divisible by $b'$. But $\gcd(a',b')=1$, so **all** prime factors of $b'$ must come from $(x-x_0)$, giving

$$
x - x_0 = b' t
$$

for some integer $t$. Substitute back:

$$
a'(b' t) = -b'(y-y_0)
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
y - y_0 = -a' t.
$$

Thus every solution has the form

$$
x = x_0 + b' t,\qquad y = y_0 - a' t,\qquad t \in \mathbb{Z},
$$

where $a'=a/d$, $b'=b/d$.

It is easy to verify that any such pair satisfies $ax+by=c$.

**Final general solution.**

Let $d=\gcd(a,b)$ and assume $d\mid c$. Put $a'=a/d$, $b'=b/d$.

If $(x_0,y_0)$ is one solution, then

$$
\boxed{
x = x_0 + b' t,\quad y = y_0 - a' t,\quad t\in\mathbb{Z}.
}
$$

If $d\nmid c$, there are **no** integer solutions.

## 4. Algorithm: how to solve $ax + by = c$ in practice

Step-by-step, no skipping:

1. Compute $d = \gcd(a,b)$ (Euclidean algorithm).
2. Check if $d$ divides $c$.
   - If not, stop: no solution.
3. Find one solution to $ax+by=c$:
   - Use extended Euclidean algorithm to find $u,v$ with $au + bv = d$.
   - Multiply by $c/d$:
     $$
     x_0 = u\cdot\frac{c}{d},\quad y_0 = v\cdot\frac{c}{d}.
     $$
4. Write $a'=a/d$, $b'=b/d$.
5. General solution:
   $$
   x = x_0 + b' t,\quad y = y_0 - a' t,\quad t\in\mathbb{Z}.
   $$

Then impose any extra conditions (e.g. $x>0$, $y>0$) to pin down which $t$ are allowed.

## 5. Example: numerical (matches textbook style)

Solve
$$
172x + 20y = 1000.
$$

### Step 1: gcd

Run Euclidean algorithm:

- $172 = 8\cdot20 + 12$
- $20 = 1\cdot12 + 8$
- $12 = 1\cdot 8 + 4$
- $8 = 2\cdot4 + 0$

So $d = \gcd(172,20) = 4$.

Check: $4 \mid 1000$, so solutions exist.

### Step 2: express gcd as combination

Work backward:

From $4 = 12 - 8$.

But
- $8 = 20 - 12$,
- $12 = 172 - 8\cdot20$.

So:

1. $4 = 12 - 8$.
2. Substitute $8 = 20 - 12$:
   $$
   4 = 12 - (20 - 12) = 2\cdot12 - 20.
   $$
3. Substitute $12 = 172 - 8\cdot20$:
   $$
   4 = 2(172 - 8\cdot20) - 20
     = 2\cdot172 - 16\cdot20 - 20
     = 2\cdot172 - 17\cdot20.
   $$

Thus
$$
4 = 2\cdot172 - 17\cdot20.
$$

### Step 3: scale to get $c=1000$

Since $1000 = 4\cdot250$:
$$
1000 = 250\cdot 4
= 250(2\cdot172 - 17\cdot20)
= (500)\cdot172 + (-4250)\cdot20.
$$

So one solution is
$$
x_0 = 500,\quad y_0 = -4250.
$$

### Step 4: general solution

Here $d=4$, $a'=172/4=43$, $b'=20/4=5$.

General solution:
$$
x = 500 + 5t,\qquad y = -4250 - 43t,\qquad t\in\mathbb{Z}.
$$

### Step 5: positive solutions (if required)

If we want $x>0$, $y>0$:

From $x>0$:
$$
500 + 5t > 0 \Rightarrow t > -100.
$$

From $y>0$:
$$
-4250 - 43t > 0
\Rightarrow -43t > 4250
\Rightarrow t < -\frac{4250}{43} \approx -98.84.
$$

So $t$ must satisfy
$$
-100 < t < -98.84.
$$

The only integer in this interval is $t=-99$.

Thus unique positive solution:
$$
x = 500 + 5(-99) = 5,\quad
y = -4250 - 43(-99) = 7.
$$

## 6. Example: “fruit problem” (translate to Diophantine)

A customer buys a dozen pieces of fruit, apples and oranges, for \$1.32.  
Apples cost 3 cents more than oranges. 

Let:

- $x$ = number of apples,
- $y$ = number of oranges.

We know:
1. $x + y = 12$,
2. (price condition) something of the form `ax + by = total` after assigning prices.

Eliminate one variable:

From $x + y = 12$, write $y = 12 - x$ and substitute into cost equation to get one equation in $x$:
$$
(\text{apple price}) x + (\text{orange price})(12-x) = 132
$$
which simplifies to linear equation
$$
4x + 3(12-x) = 132 \quad\text{(for a specific price choice)}
$$
or after simplification an equation like
$$
x + 4z = 44
$$
as in your notes.

This is exactly a linear Diophantine equation: solve using gcd and general solution; then enforce $x\ge0$, $y\ge0$ and $x,y\le12$. Only a small range of parameter values survive, giving the valid distributions.

The pattern is what matters:

1. Translate conditions to linear equations.
2. Reduce to one equation in two variables: $ax+by=c$.
3. Solve generally, then throw away parameter values that break the original word constraints.

## 7. Example: $54x + 21y = 906$

1. $d = \gcd(54,21) = 3$. Since $3 \mid 906$, solutions exist.
2. Divide everything by $3$ to simplify:
   $$
   18x + 7y = 302.
   $$
3. Use extended Euclid to express $1$ as combination of $18$ and $7$:
   - $18 = 2\cdot7 + 4$
   - $7 = 1\cdot4 + 3$
   - $4 = 1\cdot3 + 1$
   - $3 = 3\cdot1 + 0$
   Backwards:
   $$
   1 = 4 - 3
     = 4 - (7 - 4)
     = 2\cdot4 - 7
     = 2(18 - 2\cdot7) - 7
     = 2\cdot18 - 5\cdot7.
   $$
   So $1 = 2\cdot18 - 5\cdot7$.

4. Multiply by $302$:
   $$
   302 = 302(2\cdot18 - 5\cdot7)
       = (604)\cdot18 + (-1510)\cdot7.
   $$

   This corresponds to a solution
   $$
   x_0 = 604,\quad y_0 = -1510
   $$
   of $18x+7y=302$, hence of $54x+21y=906$ after scaling.

5. General solution for $18x+7y=302$:
   $d=1$, so $a'=18$, $b'=7$:
   $$
   x = 604 + 7t,\quad y = -1510 - 18t.
   $$

6. If we want $x>0$, $y>0$, derive inequalities for $t$ and choose the integer values that satisfy both (your notes do this and find specific $(x,y)$).

The method is exactly the same each time.
